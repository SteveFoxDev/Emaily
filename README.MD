This is code from a Udemy Project by Stephen Grider called Node with React: Fullstack Web Development.

My motivation for taking this course is to get another React Project under my belt to become more familiar with React.  I also wanted to understand how the frontend and backend work in Production and this course jumps right in to deploying your app.

Steps to run on your machine:
<!-- install packages in both the server and client directory -->
1. npm install 
<!-- run the backend and frontend dev server -->
2. npm run dev
