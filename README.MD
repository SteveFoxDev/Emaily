This is code from a Udemy Project by Stephen Grider called Node with React: Fullstack Web Development.

My motivation for taking this course is to get another React Project under my belt to become more familiar with React.  I also wanted to understand how the frontend and backend work in Production and this course jumps right in to deploying your app.

Steps to run on your machine:

note: There are various keys needed to run this without breaking, Google OAuth, Stripe, MongoDB URl etc.

1. npm install -
    install packages in the server and client directories

2. npm run dev -
    runs both frontend and backend dev servers
